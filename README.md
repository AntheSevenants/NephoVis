# NephoVis

The files in this folder allow you to visualize 2D scatterplots **as long as they respect a certain format**. It is not super straightforward, I will make it more user-friendly later.
This file gives you the necessary instructions to reuse this somewhere else.

One note: when I use curly braces, it means you fill in information inside, but you shouldn't write the braces.

## WHAT FILES DO I NEED?
For the visualization tool itself, clone this repository.

The data is stored in [this other repository](https://github.com/montesmariana/tokenclouds.git), which you can load as a submodule (as it is here). You only need the "data" directory there.
For each of the types you want to visualize, you would need a number of files with predefined formats and names. I should make this more flexible (in particular, allow the visualization to work "impaired" when less important files are not available).
